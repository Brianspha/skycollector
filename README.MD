### Demo
### How it Works 

Use the mouse left click to move the collector around\n
GamePlay\n
- The game basically works on the premise that you collect as the dots which correspond to the collectors current color
- Collecting an incorrect color reduces the size of the collector
- The Collector changes color constantly!
- At random times the user also collects dots which increase the time left
- Collecting an incorrect color also reduces the time given to complete the current level
- With each color collected a the player the player score updates
- Replays of the current game session can be viewed under the Replays tab and are saved on ipfs
-  

Most of the ideas above where implemented but commented out see unit test file under the test folder
